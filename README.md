JobTools

---

Like many of the software projects I spend my free time on, the scope of JobTools has ballooned well beyond the original intention.

What was once a simple script to collect and display jobs in an html table has become a full-fledged platform for collecting, filtering, sorting, and viewing job listings in a sleek, user-friendly GUI.

This project is under active development and not yet ready for a full release. Check back soon!
