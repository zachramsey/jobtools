 Control system software overview:
 

 

 The control loops involve data exchange at speeds up to 100 kHz while data collection for diagnostics purposes is done at up to 1Khz rate. There is interaction between control loops running on quad core boards and platform software that runs on IBM bladecenter. Data is stored on board in postgres databases and is shipped via the fab network to data servers in San Diego. Our graphical user interface developed using Qt serves a complex set of users - operators, engineers, scientists and customers. And we don't forget safety; the control system has a Siemens PLC to ensure both human safety is ensured, and machine damage is prevented. CPDs are user-facing applications that allow operators to perform diagnostics and maintenance. Drivers provide programmatic interfaces for changing physical components of the machine.

* Curiosity and a willingness to learn and work in a variety of embedded environments, from running on bare metal, to using and RTOS and integrating with embedded Linux
* Experience building and maintaining real-world deployed embedded systems, and handling the long tail of edge cases to ensure consistent safety, reliability and high performance
* A systems mindset and intuition for debugging; when anything could be wrong, you know how to narrow down the possibilities.
* Fluency in implementing peripheral drivers based on electrical schematics and datasheets, and debugging at this boundary in order to support prototype hardware evaluation
* Our team uses a hybrid in-office and distributed work environment, centered around our headquarters in South San Francisco, CA. You must be able to work from the office on a regular basis.
